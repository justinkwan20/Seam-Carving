# Seam-Carving
This is a project that I have worked on at University Of Massachusetts Boston. This project demonstrates seams - carving. Seams-Carving
allows one to scale images down to a lower resolution. When its scaled down it retains the most information and cuts out anything
unnecessary. This uses graphs and the picture api. There is a visual representation of Seams-Carving.
